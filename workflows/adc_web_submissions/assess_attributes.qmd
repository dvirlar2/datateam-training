## Assess attributes

New submissions made through the web editor should have attributes created by the `submitter`. If there are no attributes, or if they are incomplete, please use the <a href = 'https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/email-templates.html' target='_blank'>email template</a> to correspond with the `submitter` to ask for attributes.

Additionally, the web editor will not allow for the creation of custom units. `submitter`s should select `other/none` in the editor unit dropdown if they cannot find their desired unit. In the EML document, these will result in `dimensionless` units. Accordingly, new submissions should be checked for `dimensionless` units. This can be done with the following code. Note that this only applies if there is more than one `otherEntity`.
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dim_units <- sapply(doc$dataset$otherEntity, function(x) {
      i <- datamgmt::which_in_eml(x$attributeList$attribute, "standardUnit", as("dimensionless", "standardUnit"))
      
      out <- sapply(i, function(j){
         list(entityName = x$entityName,
               attributeName = x$attributeList$attribute[[j]]$attributeName,
               attributeLabel = x$attributeList$attribute[[j]]$attributeLabel,
               attributeDefinition = x$attributeList$attribute[[j]]$attributeDefinition)
      })
      
  return(out)  
})
dim_units <- data.frame(t(do.call(cbind, dim_units)))

dim_units
```

If dimensionless units are found, first check the `attributeDefinition`, `attributeLabel`, and `attributeName` to see if `dimensionless` seems to be an appropriate unit for the attribute. If there is any question about whether or not `dimensionless` seems appropriate, ask another member of the data team. If there is still any question about what the unit should be, reach out to the `submitter` and ask for clarification.
