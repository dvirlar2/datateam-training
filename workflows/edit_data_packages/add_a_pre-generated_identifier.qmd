## Add a pre-generated identifier to the EML

When you pre-generate a UUID or DOI, the change is not automatically reflected in the `packageId` section of the EML. Use the code below to ensure that the EML lines up with the desired identifier: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Generate DOI and add to EML
# Note that you cannot generate a DOI on test nodes
doiPid <- generateIdentifier(mn, "DOI")
doc$packageId <- doiPid
```

Be sure to include the `identifier=` argument in your <a href = 'https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/update-a-package-with-a-new-data-object.html#publish-update' target='_blank'>publish update</a> command so the pre-generated identifier is applied.
