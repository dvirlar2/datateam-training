## Use facets

We can also summarize what's in Solr with <a href = 'https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_3/faceting.html' target='_blank'>faceting</a>, which lets us **group** Solr documents together and **count** them. This is like `table` in R. Faceting can do a query within a query, but more commonly it's used to summarize unique values in a field. For example, we can find the unique `formatId`s on data objects:

- <a href = 'https://arcticdata.io/metacat/d1/mn/v2/query/solr/?q=*:*&fq=formatType:DATA&facet=true&facet.field=formatId&rows=0' target='_blank'>https://arcticdata.io/metacat/d1/mn/v2/query/solr/?q=*:*&fq=formatType:DATA&facet=true&facet.field=formatId&rows=0</a>

To facet, we usually do a few things:

- Add the parameter `facet=true`
- Add the parameter `facet.field={FIELD}` with the field we want to facet (group) on
- Set `rows=0` because we don't care about the matched Solr documents
- Optionally specify `fq={expression}` which filters out Solr documents before faceting. In the above example, we have to do this to count only data objects. Without it, the facet result would include `formatId`s for metadata and resource maps, which we don't want.

Currently, the `dataone::query()` function does not support faceting, so you'll have to run your queries as a URL.
