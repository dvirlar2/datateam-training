## Scan rar files

This section is for rar files which support data compression and file scanning. Here is how to scan rar files:

1. Download the rar file to datateam

2. In the terminal run the following on your files:

```{r eval=FALSE, error=FALSE}
mkdir to-scan && mv <file.rar> to-scan && cd to-scan
unrar e <file.rar>
```

That should scan the compressed file and each individual file it contains:

```{r eval=FALSE, error=FALSE}
clamscan *
```

Clean up by deleting the to-scan folder - 'rm -r to-scan`.
