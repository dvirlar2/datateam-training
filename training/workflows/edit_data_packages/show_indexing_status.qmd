## Show indexing status

Sometimes it takes awhile for the website to render with the updates you've made in R. To check whether a `PID` has been indexed yet, use: 
```{r eval = FALSE}
show_indexing_status(mn, pid)
```

:::{.callout-note}
The status bar will either show 0% (not indexed) or 100% (should be online already).
