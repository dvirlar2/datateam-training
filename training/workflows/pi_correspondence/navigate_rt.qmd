## Navigate RT

The <a href = 'https://support.nceas.ucsb.edu/rt/' target='_blank'>RT ticketing system</a> is how we
communicate with folks interacting with the Arctic Data Center.  
We use it for managing submissions, accessing issues, etc. It consists of
three separate interfaces:  
[Front Page](#front-page)  
[All Tickets](#all-tickets)  
[Ticket Page](#example-ticket)

### Front page 

![](../images/front_page_rt.png)

This is what you see first   

1. Home - brings you to this homepage  
2. Tickets - to search for tickets (also see number 5)  
3. Tools - not needed  
4. New Ticket - create a new ticket  
5. Search - Type in the ticket number to quickly navigate to a ticket  
6. Queue - Lists all of the tickets currently in a particular queue (such as 'arcticdata') and their statuses  
 + New = unopened tickets that require attention  
 + Open = tickets currently open and under investigation and/or being processed by a support team member  
 + Stalled = tickets awaiting responses from the PI/ `submitter`  
7. Tickets I Own - These are the current open tickets that are claimed by me  
8. Unowned Tickets - Newest tickets awaiting claim  
9. Ticket Status - Status and how long ago it was created  
10. Take - claim the ticket as yours  

### All tickets

![](../images/all_tickets_rt.png)   

This is the queue interface from number 6 of the Front page  
1. Ticket number and title  
2. Ticket status  
3. Owner - who has claimed the ticket  

### Example ticket 

![](../images/example_ticket_rt.png)  

1. Title - Include the PI's name for reference  
2. Display - homepage of the ticket  
3. History - Comment/Email history, see bottom of Display page  
4. Basics - edit the title, status, and ownership here  
5. People - option to add more people to the watch list for a given ticket conversation. Note that user/ PI/ `submitter` email addresses should be listed as "Requestors". Requestors are only emailed on "Replys", not "Comments". Ensure your ticket has a Requestor before attempting to contact users/ PIs/ `submitter`s   
6. Links - option to "Merge into" another ticket number if this is part of a larger conversation. Also option to add a reference to another ticket number  

:::{.callout-warning}
Verify that this is indeed the two tickets you want to merge. It is non-reversible.

7. Actions  
 + Reply - message the `submitter`/ PI/ all watchers  
 + Comment - attach internal message (no `submitter`s, only Data Teamers)  
 + Open It - Open the ticket  
 + Stall - `submitter` has not responded in greater than 1 month  
 + Resolve - ticket completed  
8. History - message history and option to reply (to `submitter` and beyond) or comment (internal message)

### New data submission
When notified by Arcticbot about a new data submission, here are the typical steps:

1. Update the Requestor under the People section based on the email given in the submission (usually the user/ PI/ `submitter`). You may have to google for the e-mail address if the PI did not include it in the metadata record.
2. Take the ticket (Actions > Take)
3. Review the submission based on the <a href = 'https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/initial-review-checklist.html' target='_blank'>checklist</a>
4. Draft an email using the <a href = 'https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/email-templates.html' target='_blank'>template</a> and let others review it via Slack
5. Send your reply via Actions
